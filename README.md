# xmoto 0.6.2

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2015 setup of https://github.com/xmoto/xmoto and it's dependencies. After compiling the xmoto.exe had to copied manually to xmoto. At the moment I use the xmoto.bin and the share folder from the official Release Package cuz I don't have any clue on how to build it. It should be clear that the Copyright of xmoto and of it's dependencies are not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
