# xmoto 0.6.2

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2015 setup of https://github.com/xmoto/xmoto and it's dependencies. Use libjpeg32 for a x86 build and libjpeg for a x64 build.  After compiling keep in mind the tools folder for generating the locales and the xmoto.bin. It should be clear that the Copyright of xmoto and of it's dependencies are not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
