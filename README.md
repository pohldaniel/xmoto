# xmoto 0.6.2

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2015 setup of https://github.com/xmoto/xmoto and it's dependencies. At the moment I use the xmoto.bin from the official Release Package cuz building it via "xmoto --pack" leads to a deprecated xomot.bin file. After compiling keep in mind the tools folder. Cuz of the libjpeg setup I highly recommand to with a Release x64 build. It should be clear that the Copyright of xmoto and of it's dependencies are not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
