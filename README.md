# xmoto 0.6.2

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2015 setup of https://github.com/xmoto/xmoto and it's dependencies. At the moment I use the xmoto.bin and the directories share and Textures from the official Release Package cuz I don't have any clue on how to build it. After compiling the directories xmoto/share, xmoto/Textures and the file xmoto.bin had to copied manually aside of the executable. It should be clear that the Copyright of xmoto and of it's dependencies are not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
